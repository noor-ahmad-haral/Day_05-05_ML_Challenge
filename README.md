# Day 5: Neural Networks - Handwritten Digit Recognition

Welcome to Day 5 of the 5-Day Machine Learning Revision Challenge! Today, we'll focus on Neural Networks and their application in handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

**Algorithm:** Neural Networks  
**Project:** Handwritten Digit Recognition  
**Dataset:** MNIST

In this project, you will:
1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. Normalize the data and convert labels.
3. Implement a Neural Network using TensorFlow.
4. Train and evaluate the model.
5. Visualize some classified digits.

## Tasks

### 1. Load and Preprocess the MNIST Dataset

Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and preprocess it by splitting into training and testing sets.

### 2. Normalize Data

Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1] to improve model performance.

### 3. Implement a Neural Network

Build a simple neural network using TensorFlow. The network includes:
- Input Layer
- Hidden Layers
- Output Layer

### 4. Train and Evaluate the Model

Train the neural network on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data. Use accuracy as the primary metric for evaluation.

### 5. Visualize Classified Digits

Compare the actual versus predicted labels for a few test images to visualize the performance of the model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
